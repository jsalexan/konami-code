  ## Description
  JavaScript30 Project #12 - Key Sequence Detection
  <br><br>

  These code exercises use the following technologies: JavaScript. HTML.
  <br><br>
  In this application, I practiced writing code to detect key sequences. As you type the keys you press are added an array and scanned for a specific key word. When the key word is detected in your key events, a function runs. In this case, the function adds unicorns to your page.
  <br><br>
  Good practice working on key events and arrays. Also fun to be introduced to Cornify.
